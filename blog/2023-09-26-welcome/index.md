After building apps for other companies, I decided to build my own in 2021.

I spent two months researching and testing ideas.

Compass was the one I and others were most excited about.

I built a Figma prototype and showed it to more potential users. They liked it.

Then I built a working prototype by extending an open-source calendar (Full Calendar) and added a few conceptual features.

People liked the concepts, but they said the UX needed to be a lot better.

Then I built a calendar from scratch, which took 2 years of on-and-off work.

I ran out of $ and time in Sept 2023, so I got a job and open-sourced everything.

- More details about this decision in [this post on my personal site](https://www.tylerdane.com/post/why-i-open-sourced-my-calendar-app-after-2-years).

I tried walking away from the project from Oct-Dec 2023.

In Jan 2024, I recommitted myself to the project.
