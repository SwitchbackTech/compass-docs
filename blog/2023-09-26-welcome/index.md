After building apps for other companies, I decided to build my own in 2021.

I spent two months researching and testing ideas.

Compass was the one I and others were most excited about.

I built a Figma prototype and showed it to more potential users. They liked it.

Then I built a working prototype by extending an open-source calendar (Full Calendar) and added a few conceptual features.

People liked the concepts, but they said the UX sucked.

So I started building a calendar from scratch in 2022.

I ran out of money in Sept 2023, got a job, and [open-sourced everything](https://www.tylerdane.com/post/why-i-open-sourced-my-calendar-app-after-2-years).

I worked on a few side projects in 2024 in attempt to make lots of $ before concluding: having purpose is better than having a billion dollars.

I starting working on Compass again in 2024.

I will keep improving Compass until it reaches its potential as a profitable business that changes the way people manage their time.
