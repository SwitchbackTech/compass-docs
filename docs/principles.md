# Principles

These are the principles that guide our work. You'll see these principles reflected in our docs, our code, our processes, and the product itself.

## Algorithm

This is the core process that each of us follows.

1. Say what you'll do
2. Do it
3. Reflect
4. Repeat

## Saying it

Make it clear

1. What outcome you're working towards
1. When you'll be done
1. How others can follow your progress (ie what KPIs are you tracking)

## Doing it

1. Work on one thing at a time. Don't switch contexts unnecessarily. Don't interrupt people unnecessarily
1. Make your progress visible
1. If you're blocked, let others know

## Reflecting

Get better at accomplishing your goals (the doing). But also get better at setting the right goals in the first place (the saying).

Review your

- KPIs
- Outcome
- Feelings

Get clear on

- What you'll stop doing
- What you'll continue doing
- What you'll do differently

Then just do it all again and never stop.
