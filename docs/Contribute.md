# How to Contribute

## Setting Expectations

I'm sharing more context about me and the project to help you decide on your level of investment in this project.

For better or worse, I refuse to stop working on Compass. However, I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer for another company, which means it might take me a few days to get back to you.

### Timeline

In the short-term, I'm focused on making Compass more stable and easier to use.

In the medium-term, I'll add some low-effort features that'll make Compass stand out from the competition.

Long-term, I want to turn Compass into a bootstrapped business that operates for decades.

### What's in it for you

What I can't currently offer to contributors:

- 💰 Compensation
- Immediate responses

What I guarantee:

- 🏆 Recognition (GitHub, changelogs, etc)

What I'm open to offering:

- 📝 Recommendation letter / reference for your next job (upon request)

If you're still interested in making the project better, thank you in advance!!

## Next Steps

### 🐞 You found a bug

- If the bug is a security vulnerability, please [report it here](https://github.com/SwitchbackTech/compass/security).
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching under the issues
- If it's a new bug, open a new issue, including as much relevant information as possible.

### 🛠️ You wrote a patch that fixes a bug

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### ☝️ You want to add a new feature or change an existing one

If you'd like to contribute a larger feature or fix, please create a GitHub issue to discuss the change and get the 👍 before submitting a pull request. This will ensure that we're on the same page and that your work will be accepted.

### 💅 You fixed whitespace, formatted code, or made a purely cosmetic patch

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.
