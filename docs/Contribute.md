# How to Contribute

## Setting Expectations

I'm sharing more context about me and the project to help you decide on your level of investment in this project.

For better or worse, I refuse to stop working on Compass. However, I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer for another company, which means it might take me a few days to get back to you.

### Timeline

In the short-term, we're focused on making Compass more stable and easier to use.

In the medium-term, we'll add some low-effort features that'll make Compass stand out from the competition.

Long-term, we'll turn Compass into a bootstrapped business that operates for decades.

### What's in it for you

What I can't currently offer to contributors:

- ❌ Compensation
- ❌ Immediate responses

What I guarantee:

- 🏆 Recognition (GitHub, changelogs, etc)

What I'm open to offering:

- 📝 Recommendation letter / reference for your next job (upon request)
- 📈 Preference for future opportunities @ Switchback

If you're still interested in making the project better, thank you in advance!!
