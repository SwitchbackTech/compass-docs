# How to Contribute

## Setting Expectations

I'm sharing more context about the project to help you decide on your level of investment in this project.

Short-term, we're focused on turning Compass into a minimal, yet reliable app.

Medium-term, we'll build on that foundation to make Compass into a unique and premium product that helps people make better decisions.

Long-term, Compass will become a bootstrapped business that operates for decades.

### What's in it for you

What I guarantee:

- 🏆 Recognition (GitHub, changelogs, etc)

What I'm open to offering:

- 📝 Reference for your next job (upon request)
- 📈 Preference for future opportunities @ Switchback
- 📈 Compensation

### ☝️ You want to add a new feature or change an existing one

If you'd like to contribute a larger feature or fix, please create a GitHub issue to discuss the change and get the 👍 before submitting a pull request. This will ensure that we're on the same page and that your work will be accepted.
