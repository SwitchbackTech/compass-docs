# Frontend Data Flow

## On Startup

### Store & Dispatch initialized

`ducks/events/slice.ts`

- each slice is initialized with name, props, and reducer
- all slices/reducers are combined into an `eventsReducer`
  ->
  `store/reducers.ts`
- those events reducers are added to the global `reducers` object
  ->
  `store/index.ts`
- adds all those reducers to the redux store
- uses store to init `RootState` and `AppDispatch`

## Runtime - Events

`useWeek.ts`

- imports the global dispatch from the redux store
- on render:
  - gets all week events: `getWeekEventsSlice.actions.request(...)`
- on submit:
  - if event exists (has an id): updates:
    - `editEventSlice.actions.request(...)`
  - if event doesn't exist: creates:
    - `createEventSlice.actions.request(...)`
- > (somehow knows to go to sagas ...)

`sagas.ts`

- Getting Events:
  - `getWeekEventsSaga()` -> `getEventsSaga` using this week as params
    ->
    `events/api.ts` - `eventsApi.getEvents` - uses `getEventsHelper()` to get events
- Creating Event:
  - `createEventSaga()` triggered
  - calls `eventsApi.createEvent`
    ->
    `ducks/events/api.ts` - `eventsApi.createEvent`: - creates event - creates new id, adds to running list of events in localStorage

## Runtime - Someday List

### Frontend finds someday events

`EventsList` calls `getEvents()` on load

`SidebarEventContainer` - `mapStateToProps` -> `selectors.ts`

- finds event from `entities` slice
