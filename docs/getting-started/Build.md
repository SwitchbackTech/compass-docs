# How to Build

Most of the code is written in TypeScript. The development scripts use tools to transform TypeScript into JavaScript quickly.

To run the app in production, however, you'll need to compile the code into JavaScript.

The CLI guides you through this process.

```bash
# run from root directory

yarn cli build

# follow the prompts
```

The artifacts will be placed in the `/build` directory.

See [the CLI page](../advanced/CLI) for more details about the CLI.
